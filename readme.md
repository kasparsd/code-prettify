100% automatic code highlighting using the Prettify library. No shortcodes, no classnames, fully automatic and pure awesome.


## Description

Uses a customized version of the [Code Prettify library](https://github.com/kasparsd/code-prettify-lib/pull/1) to support local styles and scripts. Plugin applies code highlighting automatically to all `<pre>` tags on the page.

**Compatible with Gutenberg and doesn't lock you in with specific markup requirements.**
